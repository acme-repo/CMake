-------

Let :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` and :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC` process
:prop_sf:`GENERATED` files.

CMake 3.10 and newer process regular *and* :prop_sf:`GENERATED` source files
in :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` and :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC`.
In CMake 3.9 and lower, only regular source files were processed in
:prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` and :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC`,
:prop_sf:`GENERATED` source files were ignored.

This policy affects how :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` and :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC` process
source files that are :prop_sf:`GENERATED`.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to *ignore* :prop_sf:`GENERATED`
source files in :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` and :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC`.

The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to process :prop_sf:`GENERATED`
source files in :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` and :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC` just like regular
source files.

.. note::
  To exclude source files from :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` and :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC`
  processing, the boolean source file properties
  :prop_sf:`SKIP_AUTOMOC`, :prop_sf:`SKIP_AUTOUIC` and :prop_sf:`SKIP_AUTOGEN`
  can be set accordingly.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.10.  CMake version
|release| warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.
Use the :command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.
